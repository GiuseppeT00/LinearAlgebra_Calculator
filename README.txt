Hi! This is a small tutorial on how to use my cpp program.
First of all, you need to insert the number of operation that you want to do.
For example, if you chose 1, and press enter, the program will ask you to insert
the number of rows and cols of your matrix.
NOTE: You need to insert these parameters in this format: r c
	So if I want 3 rows and 4 cols, I'll write 3 4 and press enter.
Then, depending on you chose, you will insert elements of your/s matrix/s.
There values will be inserted one row at time. For example, for a 3x4 matrix, I'll have:
	1 2 3 4 (press enter)
	5 6 7 8 (press enter)
	1/2 3/4 7/6 0 (press enter)
Then, the program will print your matrix.
It support integers and fraction numbers, and it will automatically does semplifications.
For example, if I write 8/4 6/4, it will print 2 3/2.
The most important thing, is to write numbers in this way:
-In a fraction number, there must NOT be space between number and '/';
-All different elements of the matrix must be separated by space;
